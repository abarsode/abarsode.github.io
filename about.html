<p>
Hi! I am Alok, a UX/front-end developer based in London, UK. I am passionate about technology, open source and building exciting products. I have worked extensively on Linux and have contributed to open source projects like <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">BlueZ</a> and <a href="https://01.org/connman">ConnMan</a>.If you find my <a href="resume/Alok_Barsode.pdf">Résumé</a> interesting, send me an <a href="mailto:barsodealok@gmail.com?Subject=Hello" target="_top">email</a> and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks! Here is a what I have been upto in the past few years...
</p>
<p>
I graduated from college with a computer science degree in 2005 and started my career writing device drivers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTLinux">RTlinux</a>. I added support for 3COM's 3c905 and Intel's e1000 NICs and added scatter-gather support in the driver. I continued working on different projects until 2008, when I started working on the linux bluetooth subsystem, Bluez, and soon caught the open source bug !
</p>
<p>
I contributed my first patchs for the HFP bluetooth profile and got invited to the <a href="http://www.bluez.org/development/helsinki2008/">2008 BlueZ developer conference</a>. The conference gave me great exposure to open source and convinced me that this is what I should continue doing! Over the next couple of years I continued contributing to Bluez. In 2010 I took part in the Google summer of Code as a mentor for Bluez. I also gave talks about the bluetooth stack at tech conferences.
</p>
<p>
In the winter of 2010, I decided to move to Helsinki to work more closely with the BlueZ folks. In early 2011 I started working on ConnMan, a free and open source networking stack. The project was in its infancy and I got a chance to contribute to a project early on, shaping it and seeing it grow. I continued to work on core ConnMan until 2012, when I decided to move to London. 
</p>
<p>
London was a UX hub for the <a href="http://www.intel.com">company</a>, and it got me interested in UX. I developed and maintained GNOME UIs for ConnMan. I also developed UI for oFono, the open source telephony stack. I soon moved to front end programming and have not looked back since ! I have done concept applications to demos, using emerging standards like <a hrf="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/">Polymer</a> and tools like <a href="https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps">CCA</a>. More on this in my Résumé.
</p>
<p>
When I am not programming, I am either listening to music, trying to take pictures with my DSLR, travelling or playing with my cat :). I love to play squash/badminton and watch tennis on the telly!
